# BumbleBees

This repository hosts the main codes developed during Claire Guerin's master's project in Prof. Ben de Bivort's lab, Harvard, under Dr. James Crall's supervision.

- In "realtime" folder are scripts for an ongoing project to track bumble bees in real time VS a posteriori as was done so far.
- In "interaction_calculations" are scripts for calculating social interactions based on tracking data 
- In "arena_designs" are CAD drawings designed by Claire (files with extension .dxf) and James (files with extension .dwg) for laser-cutting experimental arenas and other components used during the project.
